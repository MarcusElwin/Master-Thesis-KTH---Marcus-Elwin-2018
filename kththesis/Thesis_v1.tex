\chapter{Introduction}

We use the \emph{biblatex} package to handle our references.  We therefore use the
command \texttt{parencite} to get a reference in parenthesis, like this
\parencite{heisenberg2015}.  It is also possible to include the author
as part of the sentence using \texttt{textcite}, like talking about
the work of \textcite{einstein2016}.

\section{Research Question}
The research question for this thesis can be divided in to two parts:

\begin{RQ}
Will trading dynamics such as the bid-ask spread clustering, optimal trade execution and optimal inventory costs exhibited \& learned by reinforcement learning agents using competitive self-play.
\end{RQ}

\begin{RQ}
By using competitive self-play will the agents learn any new complex behavior on the simulated Nordic stock market consisting of market makers and high-frequency algorithmic traders? And how will the agents react to changed market conditions?
\end{RQ}

\section{Disposition}

%The student displays knowledge of theoretical background and previous related work (significant literature is mentioned and relevant material is used).

The background is coherent and relevant.
\chapter{Background}
In this chapter relevant theory is presented in order to give the reader a good overview of the fields study during the pre-study that are relevant for the thesis. We begin with .. and finally end with a section on previous related work.

\section{Modern Financial Markets}

\subsection{Participants}
Looking at the financial markets today \textcite{cartea2015algorithmic} broadly categories three primary classes of traders (or strategies) that partake in the market:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fundamental traders:} those who are driven by economic fundamentals outside the exchange.
    \item \textbf{Informed traders:} traders who profit from leveraging information not reflected in market prices and trading assets in the hope of their increase or decrease in value.
    \item \textbf{Market Makers:} professional trader who profit from facilitating exchange in a particular asset and exploit their skills in executing trades.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Liquidity}
One common measure to characterize financial markets are \textit{liquidity}. Liquidity impounds the usual economic concept of \textit{elasticity}, and liquidity is sometimes defined as 'depth, breadth and resiliency' \parencite{hasbrouck2007empirical}.

\subsection{Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading}


\section{Market Microstructure}
Market microstructure is the study of the process and outcomes of exchanging assets under implicit trading rules as mentioned in\textcite{o1995market}
