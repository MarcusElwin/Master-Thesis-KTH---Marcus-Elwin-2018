\chapter{Introduction}

We use the \emph{biblatex} package to handle our references.  We therefore use the
command \texttt{parencite} to get a reference in parenthesis, like this
\parencite{heisenberg2015}.  It is also possible to include the author
as part of the sentence using \texttt{textcite}, like talking about
the work of \textcite{einstein2016}.

\section{Research Question}
The research question for this thesis can be divided in to two parts:

\begin{RQ}
Will trading dynamics such as the bid-ask spread clustering, optimal trade execution and optimal inventory costs exhibited \& learned by reinforcement learning agents using competitive self-play.
\end{RQ}

\begin{RQ}
By using competitive self-play will the agents learn any new complex behavior on the simulated Nordic stock market consisting of market makers and high-frequency algorithmic traders? And how will the agents react to changed market conditions?
\end{RQ}

\section{Disposition}

%The student displays knowledge of theoretical background and previous related work (significant literature is mentioned and relevant material is used).

The background is coherent and relevant.
\chapter{Background}
In this chapter relevant theory is presented in order to give the reader a good overview of the fields study during the pre-study that are relevant for the thesis. We begin with .. and finally end with a section on previous related work.
